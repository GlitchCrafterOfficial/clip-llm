**üöÄ Get Started - Installation is a Snap:**

Before diving in, make sure you're running Python 3.12 or higher and have `pip` ready to roll.

**1. Fuel Up with Dependencies:**

`clip-llm` thrives on `litellm` and `PyQt5`.  Install them with `pip`:

```bash
pip install litellm pyqt5
```

For Linux clipboard mastery, we need `xclip` and `xbindkeys`.  Use your distribution's package manager to install these essential tools:

```bash
# For Debian/Ubuntu ninjas:
sudo apt-get install xclip xbindkeys

# For Fedora/CentOS/RHEL warriors:
sudo yum install xclip xbindkeys

# For Arch Linux masters:
sudo pacman -S xclip xbindkeys
```

**2. Install clip-llm - Join the Clipboard Revolution!**

```bash
pip install chatgpclipboard  # (Once published on PyPI - keep an eye out!)
```

**...Or, for the source code adventurers:**

```bash
git clone [repository URL]  # (Replace with the actual repository URL when available!)
cd clip-llm
pip install .
```

**‚ö°Ô∏è Unleash clip-llm - Usage in 4 Easy Steps:**

**1. Configuration Launch:**

Kick things off with the settings GUI:

```bash
clip-llm -s
```

**2. GUI Configuration - Your AI Command Center:**

The settings window is your control panel:

    * **Basic Settings:**
        * **LLM Provider:** Choose your AI overlord (OpenAI, Google, etc.).
        * **ModelID:**  Specify the model (e.g., `gpt-4`, `gemini-pro`).
        * **ApiKey:**  Enter your secret API key (we keep it safe!).
        * **Initial Prompt:** (Optional) Set the stage with a guiding prompt.

    * **Advanced Settings:**
